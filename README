Seeder version 0.01
======================

  Seeder is a framework for DNA motif discovery. It is designed for efficient
  and reliable prediction of regulatory motifs in eukaryotic promoters. In
  order to generate DNA motifs, you need one positive set of DNA sequences in
  fasta format and one background set of DNA sequences in fasta format.
